# Loan Approval Prediction

This project aims to build a predictive model to determine whether a loan application will be approved based on various applicant features. The model utilizes machine learning techniques and a dataset of historical loan applications.

## Overview

Accurately predicting loan approval is crucial for financial institutions to streamline their operations and ensure fairness. This project provides a framework to predict loan approval using historical data and modern machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information on loan applications, including demographic details, credit history, employment status, and other features.  

**Target Variable:**  
- `Loan_Status`: Binary value indicating approval (`1`) or rejection (`0`).  

**Features Include:**  
- Applicant income  
- Co-applicant income  
- Loan amount  
- Credit history  
- Property area  
- Employment status  

## Modeling Approach

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   Analyze the dataset for patterns, missing values, and outliers.  

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Scaling numerical features  

3. **Model Selection:**  
   Evaluate various machine learning algorithms, including:  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Trees  
   - Random Forests  
   - Gradient Boosting  

4. **Evaluation Metrics:**  
   Models are evaluated using metrics such as:  
   - Accuracy  
   - Precision, Recall, and F1-Score  
   - ROC-AUC  

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Loan_Approval_Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd Loan_Approval_Prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Loan_Approval_Prediction.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the step-by-step process to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.  

## Results

- Logistic Regression is the best model which given Accuracy more than 85%.  
- The model demonstrated robust performance across key evaluation metrics.
